🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 🌐 Just made a modern news website built ( Daily News ) from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered by News API. 📰

As a college student, keeping up with the news can be a struggle, especially when we don't have access to a TV, so I decided to create a user-friendly platform that delivers the latest news in a sleek and responsive design. 💼

With the help of HTML and CSS, I crafted a visually appealing layout that adapts seamlessly to different devices, ensuring a smooth user experience. 📱💻

JavaScript played a crucial role in making the website interactive and dynamic, allowing users to customize their news feed and explore articles with ease. 🔄 but without the help of News API , the website would be of no use as the API provides up-to-the-minute news from reliable sources, keeping users well-informed about current events. 🌍📊

I'm thrilled with the outcome and the skills I've gained through this project. Learning to code has been an incredible journey, and I can't wait to continue exploring new ways to merge technology with real-world applications. 🚀💡
